# Wicked Donuts Logo Integration

## 🎨 **Your Logo is Ready to Use!**

I've successfully integrated your amazing "Wicked Donuts Las Vegas" logo throughout the app and updated all the brand colors to match your logo's vibrant palette.

## 📁 **Where to Add Your Logo Files:**

Please add your logo files to this directory:
`/Users/mightybear/Desktop/WeareWicked/WeareWicked/Assets.xcassets/WickedLogo.imageset/`

**Required files:**

- `wicked-logo@2x.png` (2x resolution) 
- `wicked-logo@3x.png` (3x resolution)

## 🎨 **Brand Colors Updated:**

Based on your logo, I've updated the brand colors to:

- **Primary Red**: `#E03C4B` (from the devil girl)
- **Pure Black**: `#000000` (from outlines and frosting)
- **Pure White**: `#FFFFFF` (from border and text)
- **Light Grey**: `#CCCCCC` (from donut base)

## 🚀 **Logo Integration Complete:**

✅ **Opening Screen**: Features your logo prominently with "Las Vegas" tagline
✅ **Authentication Screen**: Logo appears in sign up/sign in flow
